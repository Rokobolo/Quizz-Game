# Quizz-Game
A Quizz game created during my 17th Day of programming course.

## What does it do?
- The program will create a True/False questions/answer pair based on the data provided in data.py.
- The question will then be asked to the user asking for an input.
- Would the input match the answer of the question, the score will go up.

- By default there are 12 questions, the program will stop once all the questions have been exhausted.

- A different set of question can be set up by collecting dataset from OpenTrivia and editing a bit the code (_main.py row 8_) to match the proper keys in the dictionnary.

## Goal of this project?
The main goal was to learn how to create a class, methos and attributes.
